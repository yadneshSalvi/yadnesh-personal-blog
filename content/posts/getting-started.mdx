Hey there, welcome to my blog!

I'm Yadnesh and you can get read more about me in the [About](/about) section.

I like coding. I'm sold on the idea that the future is Agentic. And I'm excited to code new Agents, learn from the process and share the learnings with you.

## Why this blog?

The home page says "An opinionated blog on AI Engineering", this blog site is going to be just that. 

As of 2025, I have been working as a Data Scientist in NLP domain for last 4 years. Of which the last 2.5 years have been into RAG systems, AI Workflow and AI Agents. 

I have formed some opinions along the way, and they way AI is progressing, each week feels like a year of advancements, so I'm definitely going to make more opinons with time. This site will be my outlet for sharing such opinions, and any other tutorials, projects that I work on, or reviews of tools or libraries that I use.
