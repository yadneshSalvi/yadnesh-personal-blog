"""The SSE event vocabulary: one envelope, extended forever, never changed.

Part 2 defined six event types, Part 3 added two, Part 4 three more, Part 5
one, Part 6 none, Part 7 two. Part 8 adds two more: `usage_update` (the
live meter — every thread/tokenUsage/updated becomes a wire event instead
of being swallowed at the end of the turn) and `steered` (a mid-turn
instruction was accepted into the running turn; synthetic, ours, injected
onto the thread queue by the chat endpoint so it lands in the stream
exactly where the steer arrived — the same trick app.approvals plays with
`approval/requested`).

One correction ships with the meter: `tokenUsage.total` is
THREAD-CUMULATIVE, not per-turn (verified live in Part 6: 1.09M after a
few font-hunting turns). The per-turn truth is `tokenUsage.last`. The
`complete` receipt's `usage` now carries `.last`, with the cumulative
number alongside as `thread_total` — the receipt under a turn stops
billing the customer for the whole invoice history.

Still notably absent: a "sandbox blocked this" event. The
protocol has no such signal (verified against the 0.142.4 schema and live
traces): a blocked `curl` is just a failed command (exitCode 6, the error
in aggregatedOutput), a blocked write usually never even runs (the model
knows its writable roots and declines up front), and a refused read-only
patch emits no item at all. The honest telemetry is the exit code we
already forward plus the agent's own narration — inventing a blocked_hint
would mean string-matching shell output and lying confidently.
