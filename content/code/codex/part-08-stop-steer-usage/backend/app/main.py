"""Part 8: stop, steer, and the meter — live control over a running turn.

Three controls, all keyed by one fact the backend now remembers: WHICH
turn is live on each project (app.turns, written when turn/start answers
with `turn.id`). Stop: POST /interrupt sends `turn/interrupt {threadId,
turnId}` and the stream answers with the same turn/completed every turn
ends with — status "interrupted". Steer: a chat message that arrives
while a turn is active routes to `turn/steer {threadId, expectedTurnId,
input}` instead of starting a new turn; the running build absorbs it
without restarting. The expectedTurnId precondition IS the race guard:
if the turn finished a beat before the message landed, steer fails and
the endpoint falls back to a normal turn/start. And the meter: every
thread/tokenUsage/updated becomes a `usage_update` event — `.last` for
this turn, `.total` for the thread — and the receipt's usage switches
to `.last`, because `.total` is thread-cumulative and a per-turn
receipt showing the lifetime bill is lying.
